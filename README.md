**Subject:** Vulnerability Remediation Scripts for Testing and Deployment

**Hi Suri-Sec team,**

Based on our initial vulnerability scan and assessment, we have created a set of scripts to help you tackle the initial remediation efforts. These scripts target key vulnerabilities and can be easily integrated into your deployment platform (e.g., SCCM). Please test them before deploying to production. I look forward to hearing your progress and please let me know if you run into any difficulties.

### Vulnerabilities and Remediations:
1. [**Third-Party Software Removal (Wireshark)**](https://github.com/sethsuri/Remediation-Email/blob/main/automation/remediation-wireshark-uninstall.ps1)
2. [**Windows OS Secure Configuration (Insecure Protocols)**](https://github.com/sethsuri/Remediation-Email/blob/main/automation/automation/toggle-protocols.ps1)
